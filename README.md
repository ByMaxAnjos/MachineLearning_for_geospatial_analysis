# MachineLearning_for_geospatial_analysis
Tools and techniques of machine learning applied to geospatial analysis.

##Introduction

This course aims to introduce the fundamental concepts, tools, and techniques of Machine Learning as applied to spatial analysis. It delves into data manipulation, exploration (especially spatial data), and the creation of predictive models. The approach is hands-on, fostering an intuitive understanding of Machine Learning through real-world examples and case studies, all while utilizing the R programming language and Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

The course is structured into four main parts: The first part explores the core concepts and fundamentals of Machine Learning. The second part is dedicated to learning the R language. In the third part, participants are encouraged to build their own Machine Learning models based on case studies. The final part of the course involves participants presenting their individual Machine Learning projects.

Prerequisites for this course include a basic understanding of data analysis, for example using Excel, and familiarity with GIS. Basic knowledge of statistics is also beneficial.
